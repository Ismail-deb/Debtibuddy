# NOTE: This app is configured to use the free OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model.
# To make this work, you need to set up a Streamlit Secret called "OPENAI_API_KEY".
# 1. Sign up for an OpenAI account and get your API key.
# 2. In your Streamlit Community Cloud account, go to your app's settings.
# 3. Add a new Secret with the key "OPENAI_API_KEY" and paste your key as the value.
